    Anaerobic digestion is the natural process in which microorganisms break down organic materials.  
    In this instance, ‚Äúorganic‚Äù means coming from or made of plants or animals.
    Anaerobic digestion happens in closed spaces where there is no air (or oxygen). The initials ‚ÄúAD‚Äù may refer to
    the process of anaerobic digestion or the built system where anaerobic digestion takes place, also known as a digester.

    the following columns are suggested to be included in your raw data:</p>

   <p>In this table, you'll find a summary of the required parameters and capabilities of the app. You can create your raw dataset,
   saved in a CSV file, following these data formats. This app is currently designed for a two-stage anaerobic digestion system, which 
   is the most common configuration. Developers are planning to enhance its compatibility to support one-stage and other configurations 
   in future updates.</p>
